Creating a README for your project is a great idea, especially for complex projects like the one you're working on. A README file should be clear, concise, and informative, providing all necessary details about the project in a well-organized manner. Below, I'll provide a template for your README, including a table explaining the project.

Rainwater Retention Calculator
Project Overview
This project implements an algorithm to calculate the amount of rainwater that can be retained after rainfall, given the heights of walls represented as a list of non-negative integers. The calculation mimics the retention of water in a cross-section of a relief map.

Features
Efficient Calculation: Optimized to handle lists of varying sizes efficiently.
Robust Error Handling: Gracefully handles invalid inputs, such as non-numeric or negative values.
User-friendly: Simple function prototype for ease of use.
How It Works
The rain(walls) function takes a list of non-negative integers where each integer represents the height of a wall. The algorithm calculates the total amount of rainwater that would be retained between these walls after it rains.
